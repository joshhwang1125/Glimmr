Glimmr is an image hosting website that allows users to upload pictures of any kind and share them with other Glimmr users. Glimmr was designed with user experience in mind, with the user interface and page responsiveness being two key points of emphasis during development. It is inspired by [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/).

## Overview

Glimmr is a full-stack web application built from ground up by [Joshua Hwang](https://github.com/joshhwang1125). Glimmr was built using PostgresSLQ, Rails, and React. The site uses the principles of Flux application architecture to achieve unidirectional data flow, which results in ease of debugging and simplification of data flow. Glimmr is built as a single-page app, which provides a fluid and responsive user experience. The user interface is built with custom CSS, resulting in a unique design. A JSON API is used to make efficient database queries, fetching specific data only when necessary.
